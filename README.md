# Tanuki-AI-Enhanced-DCS-Tactical-System
Adaptive Tactics System  Dynamic engagement for AI in DCS World 
Tanuki AI Ultimate 3.5 - DCS World Enhancement Script
Advanced lifelike AI for realistic air combat in DCS World 2.9+

‚ú® Features
Adaptive Tactics System

Dynamic engagement profiles (BVR, dogfight, ground attack) based on threat analysis

Role-specific behaviors (Interceptors, CAS, SEAD, etc.)

Skill-based ROE (Rules of Engagement) adjustments

Human-Like Fatigue

Pilots accumulate fatigue during combat

Reduced awareness/performance at high fatigue levels

Recovery during low-threat periods

Threat Assessment Engine

Real-time enemy distance/altitude analysis

Threat decay and "combat stress" simulation

Proximity-triggered evasion maneuvers (notch/beam/terrain)

Pilot Skill Variation

Aircraft-type specific skill ranges (Fighter: 65-98%, Bomber: 45-88%, etc.)

Randomized hesitation and decision delays

Skill degradation under fatigue

DCS 2.9+ Compatibility

Modern event handlers

Coalition-aware targeting

Full API integration

‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Save as Tanuki AI Ultimate 3.0.lua in Scripts folder

Add to missionInit.lua:
dofile(lfs.writedir()..[[Scripts\Tanuki AI Ultimate 3.0.lua]])  

No further configuration needed - Automatically activates for all aircraft

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration (Optional)
Adjust in-file constants for tuning:
-- Aggression presets (ROE values)  
AGGRESSION_LEVELS = { 
  ACE = {reaction=3, maneuver=3, roe=0}, -- 0=Weapon Free 
  ROOKIE = {reaction=1, maneuver=1, roe=2} -- 2=Return Fire 
} 

-- Fatigue rates (per minute)  
FATIGUE_FACTORS = { 
  COMBAT = 0.15,    -- High stress 
  PATROL = 0.03,    -- Routine 
  RECOVERY = 0.20   -- Rest rate 
} 

üéÆ Behavior Examples
Situation	AI Response
Enemy at 30km	BVR engagement (radar missiles)
Enemy <5km	Aggressive dogfight (guns/countermeasures)
Low-altitude CAS	Terrain masking + flare spam
Prolonged combat	Reduced radar usage + hesitation
10+ minutes fighting	Critical fatigue (50% skill reduction)
‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility
DCS World 2.9+ (Tested on OpenBeta)

All aircraft modules (Detects type automatically)

Multiplayer-safe (Client aircraft ignored)
